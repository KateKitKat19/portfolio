      Hi, my name is Kate. I have spent countless hours coding over the past year, and my GitHub
      profile is a testament to my dedication and progress. Through constant daily coding practice,
      I am constantly honing my skills and expanding my knowledge of different programming languages
      and frameworks. My previous experience in customer support has provided me with flexibility
      and stress tolerance, as well as some creativity in solving everyday problems. I am eager to
      join a friendly community of passionate professionals and learn from them. I believe that
      lifelong learning is the key to success.
